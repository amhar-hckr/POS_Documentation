## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Points to Check

Before troubleshooting further, verify the following:

1. **POS to HO Connection**
   - Use the **Command Prompt (CMD)** to confirm connectivity.
   - Example:
     ping <HO_IP_Address>
   - Ensure the response is successful.

2. **HO to Outlet Connectivity**
   - Verify the Outlet can communicate with the **Head Office**.
   - Ensure there are no network disruptions or firewall blocks.

## ‚úÖ Expected Result
- If **both connections are confirmed healthy**, the POS should automatically reconnect to the Head Office.
- If not, investigate **network issues** or **hardware failures**.
