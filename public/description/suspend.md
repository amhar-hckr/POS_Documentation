# Suspend Bill

## 📝 Description
The **Suspend Bill** function allows staff to temporarily place a bill on hold without completing the transaction.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To handle situations where a customer needs extra time (e.g., finding payment, confirming items).  
- To pause billing during emergencies or interruptions.  

---

## 📋 Steps
- **STEP-01:** While processing a bill, press the **SUS key** at any time.  

---

## ✅ Expected Result
- A suspended bill will be **printed** with the heading:  
  **“INVOICE SUSPENDED”**.
